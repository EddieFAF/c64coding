this package should contain the following files:

./exodecrunch.asm
./README
./wrap.asm
./example/exod-example.asm
./example/exod-example.prg
./example/music-mempacked.bin
./example/pic01-mempacked.bin
./example/pic02-mempacked.bin

wrap.asm and exodecrunch.asm are
almost one-to-one convert into ACME format from 
exomizer201/exodecrs/dasm/wrap.s
exomizer201/exodecrs/dasm/exodecrunch.s

----------------------------
Simple "How to use" example:
----------------------------

1.) Mempack your C64 file with exomizer without load adress

    exomizer mem -l none -o MEMPACKEDBINARY.bin INPUTFILE.prg

2.) Include "wrap.asm" and "exodecrunch.asm" sources in your source code

  exod_addr:
    !src "PATH/wrap.asm"
    !src "PATH/exodecrunch.asm"
    
3.) Include your mempacked binary with at least a label afterwards

  binary_start:
    !bin "PATH/MEMPACKEDBINARY.bin"
  binary_end:
  
4.) Prepare the depacker
    (Write lowbyte and highbyte of [ last byte of packed file ] + 1
     into the memorylocations used by "wrap.asm".
     This is very easy if you use that label like I said above.)

    lda #<binary_end
    sta opbase+1
    lda #>binary_end
    sta opbase+2
    
5.) Call the depacking routine and then continue your program
    (i.e. jump to adress if packed data was code or display a picture
     like in the given example by me)

    jsr exod_addr
 
6.) Define a variable called RELEASE before compiling*, i.e.:

    RELEASE = 1
    
7.) For proper OLDSCHOOL feeling, pack your resulting C64 executable again with
    
    http://noname.c64.org/csdb/release/?id=8740

8.) If until this point you only understood "Bahnhof"
    study ./example/exod-example.asm thouroughly. If you still are not
    sure what this is all about: ask your MOM, maybe she can help!
    
LOVE & PEACE! C64 SCENE RULEZ!

* This is the only addition by me that was not in the dasm source code.
  It is meant for easier handling when you want to include the decrunch
  code directly into your ACME code.
